This package is entirely dependent on
`Camoco <https://github.com/LinkageIO/Camoco>`_. It is is designed such that once
the Camoco has been installed, COB can be added by running:

.. code::

    $ pip install camoco-cob

.. note:: 

   Make sure you have Camoco `installed <https://camoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ correctly!


Install using Docker
--------------------
You can also run a stable version of COB using a provided Docker image. See the instructions
on installing and running COB within a Docker container here: :ref:`docker`
