COB is a browser based interface built to browse gene co-expression
networks created by [Camoco](https://github.com/LinkageIO/Camoco). The client
is written in javascript, and the server is written in python.

A demo for COB is running at http://lovelace.cs.umn.edu/cob.

## Want to get involved and contribute?
We have a project [RoadMap](https://github.com/LinkageIO/cob/issues/85) that outlines where the development of 
COB is headed. If you are interesting in contributing to our project, we have a [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/LinkageIO/cob/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document that outlines the process for getting your changes into the main COB 
repository (and get due credit!). Finally, we are committed to providing a dev space that is inclusive and accessible.
